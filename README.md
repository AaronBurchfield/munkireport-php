munkireport-php
===============

This is version 2 of munkireport-php

It is still a work-in-progress, although I'm using it in a production environment for quite some time now.

Munkireport relies on:

Serverside:
---
* php

ClientSide:
---
* jQuery
* Datatables
* Flotr2
* Moment.js

User interface:
---
* Bootstrap 3.0
* Font Awesome

For persistent storage (sorting and search in datatables) you need a browser that supports localStorage
