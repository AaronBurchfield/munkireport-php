# Adding Illuminate/View to MunkiReport PHP #

- If you had a custom dashboard view called `custom_dashboard.php`, it should now be placed in `/resources/views/show/custom_dashboard.php`.

- Each tab in the client detail view is now represented by a custom instance of a Tab View Controller.

- Custom tabs via the `client_tabs` configuration option are not currently respected.
