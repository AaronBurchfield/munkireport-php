Setup instructions for munkireport_php

On the server:
1 - Put all files in the root directory of your website (for subdirs, see below). Make sure you also copy the .htaccess file.
2 - Check if yoursite/app/db/ is writeable by the webserver

If you want to run munkireport from a subdirectory, change RewriteBase in .htaccess and $subdirectory in config.php. So if want to run munkireport from http://munki.mysite.org/report/ change the following:

.htaccess - RewriteBase /report/
config.php - $subdirectory = '/report/';

You're done with the server and should be able to see a webpage with an empty table when you visit the website with a browser.

On a mac client:

1 - Copy the scripts directory to the client
2 - Open Terminal.app
3 - cd to the scripts directory
4 - ./make_script_dmg.sh http://your-report-php-server 1.0
5 - copy the resulting dmg and pkginfo files to your munki repository

Distribute the dmg to your munki fleet.

NOTE: This will overwrite any preflight, postflight and report_broken_client scripts you might have installed.
